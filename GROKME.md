# StormsReach Application Specs

* :package: [View package](package.json)
* :briefcase: [View bundler configuration](webpack.config.js)
* :construction_worker: Under Construction

ReactJS
-------
* :sparkle: v 15.5
* TBD...

Redux
-----
* :truck: v 3.6
* Currently reads from static data until corresponding back end developed.  
See [Coming Soon](#coming-soon) below.
* TBD...

CSS Flexbox
-----------
* :ribbon: [View style source](app/assets/stylesheets/index.scss)
* :warning: Theme TBD. While I am not a designer by profession, I can follow  
along with a sophisticated CSS framework as good as any. For now I am using  
CSS Flexbox to keep layouts simple, and plan to iterate on the UI once the  
site functionality is closer to completion. While keeping up with JavaScript  
libraries is hard, I am currently considering the following libraries:
  * [Elemental UI](http://elemental-ui.com/)
  * [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)
  * [Grommet](https://grommet.github.io/docs/)

Tests
-----
* :computer: `npm run test`
  * This is my first major foray into testing a React and Redux application.  
 While I have extensive experience with testing frameworks like RSpec,  
 Minitest, or PHPUnit, I am exercising a chance to gain new experience  
 with testing JavaScript applications.  
* Facebook's [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
* Air BnB's [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
* TBD...

Heroku
------
* :shipit: Free dyno, may take 10-30s to wake from sleep.
* TBD

Coming Soon
-----------

* :neckbeard: Back end content management application tentatively written with  
the [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) framework, in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).  
  * After working for a decade with the Object Oriented paradigm, I am  curious as  
to how well the Functional Programming paradigm with Elixir harmonizes  with  
the functional nature of JavaScript.
